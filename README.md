    ## Design:

   ### Theme and Colour Scheme

The Black-Gold Color Scheme palette has 5 colors which are Chinese Black (#151515), Vampire Black (#0A0A0A), Light Goldenrod Yellow (#FBFCD4), Golden Yellow (#FFDD03) and Golden Poppy (#FBC403).

This color combination was created by user Manish. The Hex, RGB and CMYK codes are in the table below.

#### Color By color: 

Here an explanation of the 3 mains color of the pallete.

Black:

The color black has always fared well with versatility and elegance. Black signifies simplicity and functionality. This color works best in modern interior design and architecture.

On a psychological front, an all-black room can be overwhelming and gloomy. However, if you pair the color with red, white, blue, or almost anything else, it provides excellent contrast.

Contrary to popular belief, the color black is an excellent addition to interior design, especially in the kitchen, living room, dining area, and bathroom. With this color scheme, form follows function and accommodates simplistic design trends.

Emotions associated with the color Black are:

Functionality, Simplicity.

Desire, Protectiveness.

Grimness, Depression, Untidiness, Terror.

Elegance, Modernism, Sophistication.

Efficiency, Control, Beauty.


Gray:

The color Gray is another neutral color that is highly associated with elegance and style. Although there is some controversy as to the effects of gray on the human mind, if used correctly, it can have quite a positive effect.

Some people do find the color depressing. However, gray can be used as a neutralizer for vibrant color schemes. It is best to avoid using light gray colors on the walls, but you can use dark gray on one wall and surround it with happy colors such as white, yellow, or pink. You can also implement gray colors in furniture in a bright room. It adds elegance and sophistication to the design plan.

In reality, gray invokes different feelings in different people. The various shades of gray can have a calming effect for some people, while it drives others into depression. It is safer to instill gray in textiles rather than wall colors. If you do use it as a dominant room color, make sure to introduce plenty of natural light to make the room feel more welcoming and warm.

Emotions associated with the color Gray are:

Form, Functionality, Productivity, Simplicity.

Gloominess, Depression, Steely.

Strength, Power, Rigidity, Determination, Will Power.

Style, Elegance, Sophistication.


Gold-Yellow:

The color yellow is synonymous with sunshine, thereby spreading the effect of light and happiness. Yellow is also associated with intellect and prosperity, due to its close associations with the color gold.

In interior design, the color yellow is recommended for the kitchen, dining areas, hallways, and bathrooms. The color automatically uplifts peopleâ€™s spirits making the room feel bright and sunny.

Although most shades of yellow have a positive effect on the psyche, dull yellow colors instigate a feeling of doom, decay, and sickness. It is best to use yellow in its bright shades around the house. Make sure to use it sparingly though, as yellow tends to stimulate uncontrollable emotions. Due to the extreme optimistic effect, a completely yellow room can drive up blood pressure. The brain associates high blood pressure with feelings of anger thus causing people to lose their temper without any provocation.

Yellow also adds a level of sophistication to interior design, especially when it is paired with grey or white. Yellow stucco walls with grey linings and patterns gained quite the popularity in the 90s and it is making a comeback with better quality materials.

Emotions associated with the color Yellow are:

Joy, Happiness, Care, Cordiality.

Intelligence, Excellence, Obedience, Productivity.

Energy, Freshness, Nature.

Caution, Sickness, Doom, Decay, Jealousy.

Optimism, Encouragement.

## Database Schema:

### Schema: 

- To check if my schema was valid, I checked if the tables were achiving to solve the requirements of the tasks. I used DB Browser desktop app:

This image is the databases in DB browser app.

- ![Database in SQlite](static/images/dbimg.png "DB browser")

This are the 3 tables I used when started the app.

- ![Tables](static/images/3databases.png "DB browser")

Recipes table

- ![Recipes](static/images/recipiesDBSchema.jpeg "Recipes table")

- ![Database in SQlite](static/images/db2.png "DB browser")

When the app was more developed, I decided to simplify the code and Try to achive the same results in the all History pages, not using the Hystory table.

I lefted commented in the file just for documentation porpuses.

## Testing: 


### Testing results:


- [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)


 + To validate HTML and CSS code.

 - ![Validators](static/images/Cssvalidator.png "css")

 - There is one error in the HTML and templates, but is regarding the flask the flask syntax, the validator dont recognises Flask syntax as HTML.
 
 - ![Validators](static/images/HTMLvalidator.png "HTML")

### Bugs and Errors during development:

#### Debuging procces : 

For debugging and testing I used the following tools and techniques : 

+ Manual testing : Where I check manually if the differents features of the project works according the user histories.

+ User testing : Where Myself and others users impersonate the users, this allow me to collect direct feedback from real users, collecting valuables ideas to implement new features and improve the existing ones.

+ loggin I used the command a record.log file to collect differents logs during the development procces, this allow me to see where the code stop working and identify bugs.

In the next image you can see the lines of code I used tu log the results in the lrecord.log file.

- ![Logging file](static/images/searlogger.png "Loggin file procces")

In the next image you can see how the results are log in the record.log file:

- ![Logging file](static/images/Sfilerecordlog.png "Loggin file procces")

This really help me to identify Bugs and fixed during the development procces.

To be able to use this it is neccesary to type the following lne or code on your main.py file : 

<logging.basicConfig(filename='record.log', level=logging.DEBUG, format=f'%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(name)s %(threadName)s : %(message)s')>

#### Recipes History Not loading.

The issue :

When I first tryed to create a history page with all the existing recipes in the Recipes page, the template was render ok, but the list was empty, it wasn't receiving the data from the History model.

The solution : 

I tried to simplify the code, and to used what was already working and retriving data, to made the following changes:(Check images below for more details), and try collect the data from the Recipes model, as the results was the same. The user was able to see a list with all the created recipes.


- ![History ](static/images/bugs/HistoryBug.png "History List Bug")


#### Users Login not accesing the Users Table. 

The issue : 

The route for Users registration, was collecting the data into the user table corretly but the route I created for login wasn't collecting any data.

The solution : 

I was using the <reg-form.username.data> to syntax to request the data, and I changes for the <request> method imported from flask <username = request.form.get('username')>


- ![Registration ](static/images/usersBug.png "Users registration Bug")

#### Push to Heroku rejected

The issue: 

I was unable to push the changes to Heroku, I got a message saying that the push was rejected. falied to push some modules to my <heroku remote link>

The Solution:

Step-1: I merged all the conflics one by one.

Step-2: I deleted the remote I was usinng and create a new one.

Step-3: I Created a new app in Heroku and push to it.

Problem part 2 :

After I add some of the variables to the gitignore file, Heroku was giving me an error in the logs, that wasn't able to find the env.py file, and some modules, 

The solution:

After read a lot in Stackoverflow I tryed to change a bit the file structure, in the way i was working with the enviromental files, instead of using the env.py I am using .env wich has a slightly different structure, but Heroku is working ok now.


#### Css link not loading.

The issue:

The css style wasn't loading and the site didn't have any style, I was only able to see the code using the <Style> script at the bottom of the body in html.

The file path was wrong.

The solution:

I change the file path, modifications in the image below:

- ![CSS ](static/images/css-linkBug.png "CSS Bug")

As I changed the file path for the CSS file I have to changes in the images too:

- ![CSS ](static/images/CSSbug2.png "CSS Bug")


#### Users Login accepting Users with wrong password.

The Issues:

1-The login code aBle users to login with a Wrong password, it catch the error if the imput field is empty, but not if is a different password. Oprning the users name sesion.

2-Not accepting the password hash as valid.

The Solution:

    Steps: 
    1- I mannage to get the username and password hash form the Users table.
    2- I cath the errors when the imput fields are empty with anf if statement.
    3- I try to handle the I users Not exist with this specific code:

    <           if userExists is True:
                # get the user from the database
                user = Users.query.filter(Users.username == username and Users.password == password).first()
                session['username'] = user.username
                session['password'] = user.password
                session['userId'] = user.id
                session['loggedIn'] = True
                flash(f"Welcomeback, {session.get('username')}!")
                return redirect('/') 
                return render_template('start.html')
            else:
                # account dosn't exist
                errorMessage = "Invalid Username or Password "
                app.logger.info('errorMessage %s', errorMessage)>

    Final solution:
