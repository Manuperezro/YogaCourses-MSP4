    ## Design:

   ### Theme and Colour Scheme

The Black-Gold Color Scheme palette has 5 colors which are Chinese Black (#151515), Vampire Black (#0A0A0A), Light Goldenrod Yellow (#FBFCD4), Golden Yellow (#FFDD03) and Golden Poppy (#FBC403).

This color combination was created by user Manish. The Hex, RGB and CMYK codes are in the table below.

#### Color By color: 

Here an explanation of the 3 mains color of the pallete.

Black:

The color black has always fared well with versatility and elegance. Black signifies simplicity and functionality. This color works best in modern interior design and architecture.

On a psychological front, an all-black room can be overwhelming and gloomy. However, if you pair the color with red, white, blue, or almost anything else, it provides excellent contrast.

Contrary to popular belief, the color black is an excellent addition to interior design, especially in the kitchen, living room, dining area, and bathroom. With this color scheme, form follows function and accommodates simplistic design trends.

Emotions associated with the color Black are:

Functionality, Simplicity.

Desire, Protectiveness.

Grimness, Depression, Untidiness, Terror.

Elegance, Modernism, Sophistication.

Efficiency, Control, Beauty.


Gray:

The color Gray is another neutral color that is highly associated with elegance and style. Although there is some controversy as to the effects of gray on the human mind, if used correctly, it can have quite a positive effect.

Some people do find the color depressing. However, gray can be used as a neutralizer for vibrant color schemes. It is best to avoid using light gray colors on the walls, but you can use dark gray on one wall and surround it with happy colors such as white, yellow, or pink. You can also implement gray colors in furniture in a bright room. It adds elegance and sophistication to the design plan.

In reality, gray invokes different feelings in different people. The various shades of gray can have a calming effect for some people, while it drives others into depression. It is safer to instill gray in textiles rather than wall colors. If you do use it as a dominant room color, make sure to introduce plenty of natural light to make the room feel more welcoming and warm.

Emotions associated with the color Gray are:

Form, Functionality, Productivity, Simplicity.

Gloominess, Depression, Steely.

Strength, Power, Rigidity, Determination, Will Power.

Style, Elegance, Sophistication.


Gold-Yellow:

The color yellow is synonymous with sunshine, thereby spreading the effect of light and happiness. Yellow is also associated with intellect and prosperity, due to its close associations with the color gold.

In interior design, the color yellow is recommended for the kitchen, dining areas, hallways, and bathrooms. The color automatically uplifts people’s spirits making the room feel bright and sunny.

Although most shades of yellow have a positive effect on the psyche, dull yellow colors instigate a feeling of doom, decay, and sickness. It is best to use yellow in its bright shades around the house. Make sure to use it sparingly though, as yellow tends to stimulate uncontrollable emotions. Due to the extreme optimistic effect, a completely yellow room can drive up blood pressure. The brain associates high blood pressure with feelings of anger thus causing people to lose their temper without any provocation.

Yellow also adds a level of sophistication to interior design, especially when it is paired with grey or white. Yellow stucco walls with grey linings and patterns gained quite the popularity in the 90s and it is making a comeback with better quality materials.

Emotions associated with the color Yellow are:

Joy, Happiness, Care, Cordiality.

Intelligence, Excellence, Obedience, Productivity.

Energy, Freshness, Nature.

Caution, Sickness, Doom, Decay, Jealousy.

Optimism, Encouragement.

## **TESTING**
### **HTML Testing**
Using - W3C Markup Validator
Errors and Warnings in the .html files have been attended with the help of W3 .html Validator. After alterations, no major errors were found in the .html files; Most were related to the django templates. The few slightly concerning errors have been documented below
| FILE | Result | Comment
--- | --- | --- |
checkout.html | [image](readme/images/w3_checkout.png) | could not resolve error 7
footer.html | [image](readme/images/w3_footer.png) | do not believe a title element is needed regarding error 2 and 3
navigation.html | [image](readme/images/w3_navigation.png) | did not want to alter with error 12 and 13 as it is from Bootstrap and changing of any id names most likely will interfere with the builtin in bootstrap jquery/js

[top](#content)

### **CSS Testing**
| FILE | Result | Notes
base.css | [image](readme/images/w3_base_css.png) | 2 warnings were related to the colours of the background and border of a class element being the same

[top](#content)

### **PEP8 Testing**
* I used pep8online to check whether my .py file codes were PEP8 compliant. I made the changes needed for an All right pass for all .py files.
* After changes were made, an internal server error occured. I had to revert some line of codes (as told to me by my Gitpod terminal) back to its original state for the website to work. More details can be found in ['Bugs and Fixes'](#bugs-and-fixes) section
